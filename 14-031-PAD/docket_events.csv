Present: AUSA Desiree Laborde and Attorney Mariangela Tirado. The Government informed parties are in advanced plea negotiations and a final plea agreement was sent to the defendant.

Further, counsel informed they expect to file a change of plea motion within the next two weeks, and advanced that a straight plea will be entered on Crim. 19- 625 (PAD) where a recommendation of concurrence of sentence will be submitted. Follow-Up Status Conference set for 7/6/2021 at 09:30 AM via Teleconference before Judge Pedro A. Delgado-Hernandez.
