The defendant consented to proceed by VTC, and he secured waiver to that effect that appears on the record. The interpreter assisted the defendant via telephone at FPD's Office and we had a clear view of him on screen. Defense counsel stated there are no contested facts in this case, that the defendant has accepted responsibility as to the grade c violations, and requested that defendant be sentenced to time already served with no supervision to follow. The Government concurred with defense counsel's request for time served as to imprisonment term, but differed in counsel's request for no supervision to follow. Further, it stated that defendant's non-compliance with supervision terms warrants that, in the present revocation, an additional term be imposed. Allocution heard. The Court found that defendant violated the conditions of supervised release, and  supervised release term was REVOKED.

The defendant waived his right to be physically present for the revocation hearing and consented to proceed by VTC. The Court made a finding pursuant to the CARES ACT that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be physically present for the revocation hearing, since he has consented to proceed by videoconference after consultation with counsel of record. Certified Court interpreter Felix Toledo was acting and assisting the defendant on a secured line at MDC-Guaynabo and the Court had a clear view of him on screen. The defendant waived the hearing and accepted the violations of the conditions of supervised release as stated by the U.S. Probation Office at ECF No. 2943. Counsel for the defendant proceeded to provide several mitigations factors to be considered by the Court, and requested the defendant be sentenced to time served and be transferred to a Halfway House. The United States requested a term of 10 months and additional Supervised Release term. Defendant refused to allocute.

Accordingly, the supervised release term imposed on July 18, 2011 was revoked. Imprisonment for a term of 6 months.
