Argues there was a misunderstanding and the defendant did not mean to blatantly disregard and not comply with conditions of supervised release. Requests she be allowed to remain serving her SRT. USPO Ivelisse Alonso addresses the Court and states that defendant was indeed informed on 10/6/2015 that she had to report to the USPO, yet she failed to do so. Sidebar Conference held. Defendant's allocution heard.  Court finds basis to revoke, however, will afford the defendant one last opportunity. Defendant is strongly admonished that she must comply with all her conditions of SRT, should she not comply, she will be arrested and will remain under custody. Therefore, the electronic monitoring device is to be installed today. Defendant is to remain in home incarceration 24/7 for the next 3 days. The defendant or her mother, within the next 3 days, are to purchase a mobile phone to monitor the electronic device. Case will remain open and matter will be revisited on 12/7/2015.

Present: AUSA Elba Gorbea, AFPD Laronda Martin, USPO Ivelisse Alonso. The Court informs that the defendant has been complying with the condition of reporting to USPO. In one occasion she claimed to have had an emergency and she was authorized to go to the Emergency Room that she would take and send pictures of the surrounding in order to verify that in deed she had gone there.

The Court explains to the defendant that the next time she has a similar situation, she needs to verify that in fact the photos are delivered correctly.
