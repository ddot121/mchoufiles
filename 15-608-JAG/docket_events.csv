03/10/2021,1480,"ORDER denying without prejudice 1465 Motion to Reduce Sentence - First Step Act as to Ruben Barcelo-Severino (2); noted 1471 Motion in Compliance as to Ruben Barcelo- Severino (2); noted 1479 Motion in Compliance as to Ruben Barcelo-Severino (2). Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies, (2) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (3) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. If the Court were to excuse the exhaustion of administrative remedies, Defendant provided some evidence showing he suffers from obesity, which according to the CDC places Defendant at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. His medical condition- -coupled with the fact that FCI Marianna currently has 15 cases of COVID among the staff, 249 recovered inmates, and 40 recovered staff--might be sufficient to establish extraordinary and compelling circumstances. However, Defendant has failed to show that he does not pose a danger to the community, considering the crime of conviction and his leadership role in the offense; or that a sentence reduction would be consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements, considering that Defendant has served less than 40% of his sentence of imprisonment. For these reasons, Defendant's Motion is hereby DENIED without prejudice. Defendant may refile the present motion provided he submits evidence to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Finally, Defendant has failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction over any request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmate's place of incarceration.
