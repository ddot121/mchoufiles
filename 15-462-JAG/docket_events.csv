12/07/2018,3877,"ORDER denying 3611 Motion to Clarify as to Jose D. Resto-Figueroa (60). The government argues that the mandatory minimum sentence for Count Nine is ten years pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1)(A)(ili), which increases the minimum sentence ""if the firearm is discharged."" However, the Supreme Court has held that, because "" [mJandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime... any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an 'element' [of the crime] that must be submitted to the jury."" Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99, 103 (2013). A finding that the firearm was discharged would increase the mandatory minimum for Count Nine. Thus, because the issue was not submitted to the jury, see Docket No. 2796, the Court finds that the mandatory minimum sentence for Count Nine is five years pursuant to  924(c)(1)(A) (i).

09/03/2019,4246,"COPY OF ORDER denying | Motion to Vacate, for the reasons stated in the government's Opposition, Docket No. 20. Specifically, Petitioner's claim that he was unaware of the possibility of a consecutive sentence is conclusively refuted by the record. The Plea Agreement repeatedly stated that the Court was not bound by the agreement, and that the government would recommend a consecutive sentence. Docket "
NoDate,1,"2 at 3-5. Then, at the Change of Plea Hearing, the Court reiterated this before Petitioner responded that he understood the implications of his guilty plea and that he still wished to enter such a plea. Docket No. 20 at 7-8. Moreover, Petitioner's claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal likewise fails. Despite the waiver clause in the Plea Agreement, Petitioner instructed his trial counsel to appeal based on his belief that the consecutive sentence imposed was unreasonable. However, because Petitioner had ample notice of the possibility of a consecutive sentence before knowingly and voluntarily pleading guilty, the basis for such an appeal would have been meritless. See United States v. Pacheco, 921 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2019) (""A waiver of appellate rights is enforceable provided that, among other things, the defendant enter[ed] into the waiver knowingly and voluntarily."") (quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, counsel's failure to appeal cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See Acha v. United States, 910 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating that attorneys are ""under no obligation to raise meritless claims [and] [fJailure to do so does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.""). Finally, the Court rejects Petitioner's double jeopardy claim because there is insufficient evidence on the record to show either that the two criminal cases involved identical offenses, or even that both cases dealt with the same act or transaction. For these reasons, the Court denies Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it cannot find that counsel's choices were ""so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made [them].""

Specifically, Petitioner's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim and the grounds provided in support thereof are refuted by the record, so Petitioner has failed to show that his attorney's performance was deficient; and/or that there is a reasonable probability that, but for his attorney's unprofessional errors, the proceedings would have yielded a different result. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 669 (1984). Moreover, Petitioner's offense of conviction for Count Three did not involve a crime of violence (rather, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime); and Petitioner was not sentenced under (or subject to) the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.  924(e), or the Career Offender Guideline, U.S.S.G.  4B1.1, so Johnson is inapplicable to the instant case. See Muoz-Rivera v. United States, Case No. 16-CV-2308, 2019 WL 4784895, at *3 (D.P.R. Sep. 30, 2019) (finding Johnson inapplicable to sentences resting upon  924(c)(1)(A) when these pertain to the use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime). Finally, the Court ORDERS that no certificate of appealability should be issued in the event that Petitioner files a notice of appeal because there is no substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right under 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(2).

10/14/2020,4232,"ORDER denying 4218 Motion Requesting Order as to Walter D. Muller-Colon (63). Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies; (2) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (3) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (4) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Even if the Court were to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Defendant's motion lacks specific information and evidence supporting the allegations of preexisting health conditions that would increase for Defendant the risks posed by COVID-19 infection beyond the risks posed to the general population. See United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 poses in the federal prison system... But the mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus's spread.""). Defendant alleges that he suffers from respiratory issues but the medical records submitted show a single instance of pneumonia in September 2017. The record contains no evidence of respiratory issues after this date--the physician's note submitted is based on a review of Defendant's 2017 medical records, not on a recent medical examination. Defendant has similarly failed to show that he does not pose a danger to the community, considering his drug and firearm convictions; or that a sentence reduction would be consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements. For these reasons, Defendant's Motion is hereby DENIED without prejudice. Defendant may refile the present motion provided he submits evidence to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Finally, Defendant has failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction over any request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmates place of incarceration. See 18 U.S.C.  3621(b). Signed by Judge Jay A. Garcia-Gregory on 10/14/2020. (MQ) Modified on 10/14/2020 to edit docket text as per Chamber's request. (mg). (Entered: 10/14/2020) "

02/25/2021,4292,"ORDER as to Jose E. Rivera-Maldonado (58) denying without prejudice 4277 Motion to Reduce Sentence; noted 4286 Motion in Compliance. Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that a sentence reduction is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) extraordinary and  compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (2) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (3) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Defendant exhausted administrative remedies, but his motion lacks any evidence supporting the allegations of preexisting health conditions that would increase for Defendant the risks posed by COVID-19 infection beyond the risks posed to the general population. See United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 poses in the federal prison system... But the mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus's spread.""). The motion similarly lacks any evidence regarding the alleged family circumstances. Defendant has also failed to show that he does not pose a danger to the community, considering the crimes of conviction, his prior criminal history, and his multiple disciplinary infractions while imprisoned (including assault without serious injury, possession of unauthorized items including drugs and/or alcohol, possession of hazardous tool, interfering with staff, and refusing to obey order); or that a sentence reduction would be consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements. For these reasons, Defendant's Motion is hereby DENIED without prejudice. Defendant may refile the present motion provided he submits evidence to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Finally, Defendant has failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction over any request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmate's place of incarceration.
