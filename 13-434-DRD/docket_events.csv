10/05/2016,1094,"ORDER as to Marcos Rodriguez-Maldonado (2). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1), ""a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court  within 14 days after... the entry of... the order being appealed."" However, ""[u]pon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may--before or after the time has expired, with or without motion and notice--extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the"" aforementioned 14- day period. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4). As this is a case where the notice of appeal was filed after the required 14 days, but before the subsequent 30 days, the First Circuit has ordered that this Court determine whether it will deem the instant notice of appeal timely. Prior to ruling, the Court requested information from the Bureau of Prisons and the Federal Public Defender's Office. See Docket No. 1088 . The Federal Public Defender's Office response is found at Docket No. 1089 and the Bureau of Prisons' response is found at Docket No. 1091 . After meticulous scrutiny of the record and careful consideration, the Court must deem the notice of appeal untimely. The Court shall explain its reasoning. Defendant alleges in his notice of appeal that he received notice of the Court's denial of his motion for reduction of sentence on August 8, 2016. See Docket No. 1081 . However, on July 22, 2016, Defendant received a letter from the Federal Public Defender's Office that stated that the motion to reduce his sentence was denied in an order dated July 15, 2016 and advising Defendant of his right to appeal, and the time frame for doing so. See Docket No. 1089 , Exhibit 1. Even if the Court were to equitably take July 22, 2016, as the notification date for the order being appealed, Defendant's notice of appeal, filed on August 16, 2016, does not comply with the 14-day deadline. Moreover, Defendant has not demonstrated ""good cause"" or ""excusable neglect"" for the delay. Notwithstanding, even an independent inspection of the record yields no reason for which to find ""good cause"" or ""excusable neglect."" Pursuant to the First Circuit's instructions, copies of this ruling shall be forwarded to the First Circuit forthwith. See Docket No. 1087 . Signed by Judge Daniel R. Dominguez on 10/5/2016.
