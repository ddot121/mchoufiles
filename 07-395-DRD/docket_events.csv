In said motions, the Defendant seeks relief pursuant to the opinion of the Eastern District of New York in United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d 310 (EDNY 2014). This Court finds that Holloway is a district court decision from another jurisdiction that has no controlling effect on this Court. See Wade v. United States, 2015 WL 7732834, at *2 (D. Md. 2015) (finding ""no basis to apply the benefits of the Holloway decision, a New York federal district court ruling, to [Defendant's] criminal cases""); United States v. Horton, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78611, at *3 (E.D.N.C. June 16, 2016) (viewing the Holloway Doctrine as not so much a doctrine, but as ""a single case carrying no precedential weight in this court."") Additionally, a threshold requirement for applying the court's reasoning in Holloway 1s that the Government must agree to a reduced sentence. See Acuna v. United States, 2016 WL 3747531 (D. Hawaii, July 8, 2016) (declining to follow Holloway and noting Holloway is contingent on the Government's acquiescence.) In the case at bar, the Government does not agree to a reduction of Chevres-Motta's sentence. See Dkt. 1043 Subsequent Disagreement Memoranda by USA. Therefore, the Defendants motion must be DENIED.
