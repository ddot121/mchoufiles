09/26/2018,859,"ORDER as to Reynaldo Rivera-Ruiz (10) re 858 Initial Appearance - Revocation Proceedings. During the defendant's initial appearance, the Court reviewed the defendant's financial affidavit and found that the defendant was unable to afford the services of his own attorney. For that reason, the Court was prepared to appoint the Federal Public Defender's Office to represent him throughout all stages of the proceedings in this case. It was then brought to the Court's attention that defendant was already represented by Ms. Jennie Espada in a separate but related case. Thinking that Ms. Espada was assigned counsel, the Court ordered her to represent the defendant in this case as well. It has recently come to the Court's attention, however, that Ms. Espada is  retained to represent the defendant in that separate but related case. Given the fact that the defendant can afford the services of Ms. Espada to represent him in the separate but related case, the Court finds that he is not indigent and therefore has the means to retain counsel to represent him in this case. Accordingly, the Court finds that the defendant is ineligible to have the Court assign him counsel in this case. Signed by US Magistrate Judge Marshal D.
