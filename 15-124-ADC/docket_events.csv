Defendant waived the reading of the Indictment. Plea of Not Guilty is entered. During the colloquy, the Court asked defendant if he understood what he was being charged and the maximum penalties, for defendant answered in the affirmative. Defense is granted seven (7) days to obtain discovery and fourteen (14) days thereafter to file all motions. The case is referred to the Judge for trial setting thereafter. As to Bail, the Government proffered defendant's role and/or participation, that defendant is detained in another case and is awaiting sentence and moved for detention. Defense counsel proffered that defendant be placed on a recommended bond in the pretrial report from the other case, that parents may serve as third party custodians, that their property may be posted as collateral for bail and that home detention may be placed as a condition. After listening to the parties, the Court took the matter under advisement pending the review of the pretrial report of that other criminal case before Judge Fuste. (Court Reporter FTR/bg.)
