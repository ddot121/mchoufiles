AUSA Cesar Rivera and defense counsel Raymond Rivera were present. Defense counsel had the opportunity to speak with the probation officer, with the Government and client. Although there may be a possibility of a drug treatment program, but at this time, defendant does not contest that the violations occurred. The Government requested that defendant be remanded to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and that bail be revoked. After hearing the parties, the Court ordered the bail revoked. If at any time, defendant is in a better position to assert self imposed controls, together with the probation officer, conditions may be crafted. But at this time, the Court finds no condition or combinations of conditions that would assure the safty of the community. Defendant is ordered detained. (Court Reporter FTR/bg.)

Richard Dansoh. The 817 MOTION to Withdraw as Attorney filed by Jose R. Levy-Diaz, pro se, was discussed with the parties and the defendant. The Court stated that defendant raised three grounds in his motion: for lack of visits, lack of discussion of discovery and plea negotiations. The Court did not find merit on any of the three grounds, did not find at all that defendant has been receiving ineffective assistance of counsel, and stated there has been no  breakdown in the communication process. The Court only found that there was a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship based on lack of trust. Therefore, the Court will recommend to the District Judge that a new attorney be appointed to represent the defendant. Counsel Dansoh shall continue with defendant's representation until new counsel is appointed by the Court unless Judge Garcia decides on the contrary.

Defendant has failed to present any new argument or evidence that would warrant the Court revisiting its prior holding that Defendant failed to establish that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). See Docket No. 1887. While Defendant provided evidence of exhaustion of administrative remedies, he has failed to establish (1) extraordinary and compelling reasons Justifying a reduction in sentence; (2) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (3) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. ""[T]he mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus's spread."" United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020). While COVID-19 is an especially serious threat to individuals with chronic health conditions, Defendant does not even allege any medical condition that would put him at higher risk of complications from exposure to COVID-19. In fact, Defendant ""described himself as a healthy man with no history of serious illnesses in his presentence interview, Docket No. 1030 at 15; the BOP has categorized him as ""Care 1 - healthy or simple chronic care,"" Docket No. 1897-1 at 15; and the BOP denied his request for compassionate release in part because he has ""no noted medical history [and] is not enrolled in any chronic care clinics,"" Docket No. 1919-2. Thus, Defendant has failed to establish extraordinary and compelling reasons. Moreover, Defendant has failed to show he does not pose a danger to the community, especially considering (1) his drug and firearm convictions, (11) his leadership role within the drug trafficking organization; and (111) his disciplinary infractions during his imprisonment.

Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A).

Even if the Court were to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Defendant's motion lacks specific information and evidence regarding (1) the risk of COVID-19 infection at the facility where he is currently being held, especially considering the BOP's efforts to address the pandemic; and (2) his allegations that he does not pose a danger to the community, considering his drug and firearms convictions, prior arrests, leadership role within the drug trafficking organization (for which he received a 4 level enhancement), and two disciplinary infractions while imprisoned for possession of a hazardous tool and possession of a dangerous weapon.

Sanchez-Ortiz (22); noted 1945 Motion in Compliance as to Jose L. Sanchez-Ortiz (22). Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies; (2) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (3) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (4) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Even if the Court were to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Defendant has failed to provide any evidence of the alleged extraordinary and compelling circumstances, nor is the Court convinced that these rise to the level of extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a sentence reduction. Defendant has similarly failed to show that he does not pose a danger to the community, considering his drug and firearm convictions and his disciplinary infractions while imprisoned; or that a sentence reduction would be consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements. Finally, Defendant has failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction over any request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmate's place of incarceration. See 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b). For these reasons, Defendant's Motion is hereby DENIED without prejudice. Defendant may refile the present motion provided he submits evidence to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Signed by Judge Jay A. Garcia- Gregory on 12/15/2020.
