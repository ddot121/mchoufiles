04/28/2011,289,"ORDER denying 286 Motion for Reconsideration as to Ricardo Amaro-Santiago (9). The court carefully reviewed once again in their entirety videos-ids 587 and 586 jointly, as submitted by defendant along with this motion in the DVD Exhibit which shall be made part of the record. The court sustains its earlier findings and conclusions. As a whole, the transaction involving defendant Amaro lasts close to one (1) hour. The court,once again, simply cannot conclude that the undercover agent's actions are shocking to the conscience when the entire video is considered as a whole. More so, the incidents characterized by defendant as his kidnapping and murder threat are but a mere fraction of the video itself. More so, the overall video, taken from an objective standpoint of a drug transaction taking place, does not support defendant's argument. There is even a point in the recording when defendant shows a weapon to the undercover agent and talks about the same. At other times, he sits along the undercover, and at others dialogues and jokes with those present. The court notes that at footnote 2 of his motion defendant states that if a hearing is held, he ""may testify''. Such statement, without more, does not warrant the holding of an evidentiary hearing, nor alter the court's determination made from the video in evidence. This ruling, of course, does not preclude defendant from raising an entrapment defense at trial. Finally, the request to certify this issue to the First Circuit is DENIED.Signed by Judge Gustavo A.

09/29/2011,471,"ORDER denying 428 Motion Requesting Order as to Ricardo Amaro-Santiago (9). The Court agrees with the government that the Constitution and Laws of the United States do not automatically compel the prosecution to provide an original item of evidence to defense for examination and relinquish all custody to the same. The government has informed for quite some time now that the original is available for inspection at the FBI's San Juan Office. Defendant has failed to adduce any reasons as to why the items in question can only be examined in the expert's California location in his ""state of the art"" lab. The expert does not state anywhere in his letter (Docket 284 - attachment 3) that he cannot perform such tests in PR. Any travel cost to the expert to San Juan, Puerto Rico, of course, will be paid with pre-approved CJA funds. The Court notes, however, that it is ready to set a trial date, as retired Chief Magistrate Judge Arenas would say, ""carved in New Hampshire granite"". Accordingly, any expert examination must be scheduled to take place with all due speed, and results thereof provided to the government as per Rule 16. Counsel for the USA and defendant Amaro shall within the next five(5) working dates agree to an examination date in Puerto Rico. If no date is agreed the Court will set one. (The government's opposition Dkt # 435 and defendant Amaro's reply Dkt # 436-1 are duly noted and have been considered by the court in its ruling). Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 9/29/11.

11/27/2011,622,"***SELECTED PARTIES***ORDER as to Javier A. Diaz-Castro The Government informed some time ago that plea negotiations had ended and that it was ready to go to trial. More recently, counsel for defendant, in one of her filings, submitted  that she replaced previous counsel, who misinformed defendant of the applicable penalties in this case vis a vis the evidence provided in discovery. Thus, she did not have the same opportunity that other counsel and defendants had since day one. While the court cannot involve itself in plea negotiations between the parties, it nonetheless is compelled to state the following. This takes into account the principle that the Government does not have to negotiate any given case, and if it does, it is free to terminate its negotiations and rescind any unaccepted plea offer it may have made. Notwithstanding, it is the undersigned's experience that in a significant percentage of criminal cases before him, a plea is ultimately reached AFTER JENCKS AND GIGLIO MATERIAL IS DISCLOSED TO DEFENDANT. While the trial of this case remains set for December 5, 2011, counsel for the government are urged during the week to come to consider meeting one final time with defense counsel in a good faith effort to discuss and resolve this case via plea. The case will not be continued for purposes of negotiations, but from the court's broader perspective, perhaps a FAIR outcome similar to that of other codefendants may be reached by counsel, who are officers of the court. These remarks by the court -- limited to counsel in this upcoming trial -- do not constitute a reason for either counsel not comply with any outstanding court-imposed deadlines. But given that counsel are to meet this week, they may consider this matter among all other matters. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 11/29/11.(Gelpi, Gustavo) (Entered: 11/27/2011) "

The court finds the proffer made by defendant is insufficient under the Rules of Evidence as these pertain to expert testimony (and as per the Daubert standard). The court agrees with the government at page 5 of its motion as to the lack of ""basis of knowledge concerning any purported generally applicable standard of care for federal undercover investigations or the handling of confidential informants"".

If any other transcript is required, counsel shall also do so before said date. The Court is cognizant of the Government's interest in having defendant Amaro sentenced.

Objections to the PSR. Defense attorney requested that sentencing hearing be continued pending the resolution of the Smarter Sentencing Act. The Court denied the request and informed counsel that perhaps what could be done would be to not enter Judgment immediately or for counsel to file a post judgment motion. The Court clarified that for purposes of jury counts 25s, 26s and 29s were renamed as cts 1, 2, 3, as to not confuse the jury and that the indictment had not been changed. The defendant stands convicted of cts 25s, 26s and 29s as charged in the superseding indictment. The Court heard extensive arguments on government's objection to PSR granting defendant a minor participant role in the offense. After hearing arguments, the Court overruled government's objection, and granted defendant an adjustment for minor participant. In addition, the Court heard arguments from defendant in regards to the mandatory minimum drug amount. Defense counsel also requested that defendant's testimony be taken as the equivalent of safety valve. Both arguments were overruled but were preserved for the record. Defendants allocution heard. Counts 25, 26, 29, 33, Dismissed; Counts 25s, 26s, 29s, Term of Imprisonment-120 months as to counts 25s and 26s to be served concurrently and 60 months as to count 29s to be served consecutively for a total time of imprisonment of 180 months; SRT-5 years as to each count to be served concurrently; SMA-$300.00; Forfeiture-any property used or intended to be used to commit the offense.

The defendant therein, like defendant Amaro herein, was not a police officer, had no criminal record, and no prior contact with any government agent prior to the events of this case.

The government shall respond to the same on or before August 5, 2014, along with its response to Amaro's motion for reconsideration of sentence imposed (Docket No 1080 ).

11/05/2014,1131,"ORDER: Denying 1130 Motion to Reduce Sentence - USSC Amendment 782 as to Arnold E. Benitez-Rivera (5). In this case, Defendant faced a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of ten years for the drug count (21 U.S.C § 846 and 841), followed by a minimum consecutive term of imprisonment of five years for the firearm count (18 U.S.C § 924(c)) -- a total of fifteen years mandatory minimum. By way of plea agreement, he reduced his exposure, and the ultimate sentence being two years for the drug count, followed by five years for the weapon count, for a total of 84 months. This is almost half of the mandatory sentence he would have received (180 months). The court further notes that at the time of committing the offense at bar, Defendant was a PRPD Officer who rather than serve and protect the citizenry, was protecting with his firearm a drug transaction (which turned out to be a sting operation). The court, in the exercise of its discretion, hereby opts not to reduce Defendant's sentence any further than negotiated in his plea agreement. In the court's opinion, the aforementioned facts warrant that he serve the entire sentence imposed upon him, and not a single day less. He has already benefitted enough by virtue of his plea agreement. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi (AS) Modified to Read ""(180 months)"" on 11/5/2014 (su). (Entered: 11/05/2014) "

The fact that defendant's sentimental  life has taken a different turn, while unfortunate perhaps, is now not a ground for the court to amend its judgment with another recommendation. Notwithstanding, the court notes that its previous denial of defendant's motion for compassionate release was without prejudice. Defendant under the First Step Act may perhaps be entitled to said relief, but only complying with administrative exhaustion components. If warranted, the court will revisit the matter.

June 3, 2021), to the effect that retroactive unstacking may not be used as grounds for compassionate release. Congress could have so provided, however, it has not. The Court is aware that Diaz Castro's sentence - the result of the then existing mandatory minimum stacking scheme - 1s indeed severe. In fact, Diaz Castro has offered independent medical grounds for compassionate release. These are not supported by an expert medical opinion tailored to his particular conditions and prognosis. As such, he may resubmit his compassionate release motion supported by an expert opinion, if warranted. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 6/28/2021. (MES) (Entered: 06/28/2021) "
