PO Santana addressed the Court explaining the instructions given to the defendant and the perimeter of the monitoring device in the house defendant is staying. Defense counsel offered an alternative residence farther from the housing project. The Court ruled that in essence defendant was admitting to the violations contained in the motion, that defendant had the most restrictive conditions which could be imposed and he still failed to comply with the same.
