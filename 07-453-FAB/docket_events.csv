10/20/2020,3538,"ORDER as to Jaime Agosto-Santana (51): In essence, the government opposes the USPO's request for early termination of supervised release because (a) defendant's crime demonstrates ability to place his interests above those of society and such conduct should not be rewarded with early termination of supervised release; (b) the term of supervised release adequately promotes deterrence of criminal conduct and provides protection of the community from further crimes of the nature that defendant committed; and (c) defendant received all potential benefits in this case through the consideration and approval of a plea agreement with the United States and in that sense, received the sentence that he bargained for (Docket No. 3535, p. 2). The government does not, however, analyze the elements that the USPO has put forth in support of its motion. The government should do so by October 30, 2020, including relevant caselaw and other sources of authority addressing the points that the USPO has referred to, to explain why those points do not warrant early termination of supervised release.

Present: AUSA Mare Chattah, AFPD Cherrelle Herbert, and USPO Alexandra Castellanos. The record should reflect the proceedings are being held by VTC, given the emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The interpreter is acting and assisting the defendant via telephone. The defendant is present via VTC and we have a clear view of him on screen. After having heard the parties, the Court found that defendant violated the conditions of supervised release. Therefore, supervised release term was REVOKED.

The Court deemed it appropriate to appoint counsel. The FPD was appointed to represent the defendant. Defendant was ordered temporarily detained. A preliminary revocation hearing is set for 3/16/2021 at 9:30 am via VTC before US Magistrate Judge Marcos E. Lopez. If the government intends to call a witness that is not fluent in the English language, failure of the government to timely retain the services of an interpreter may result in the imposition of sanctions. As required by Rule 5(f), the United States is ordered to produce all exculpatory evidence to the defendant pursuant to Brady v. Maryland and its progeny. Not doing so in a timely manner may result in sanctions, including exclusion of evidence, adverse jury instructions, dismissal of charges and contempt proceedings. (Court Reporter Zoom Recording.)

Present: AUSA Jose Contreras, AFPD Victor Chico Luna, and USPO Ruben Velez. The defendant was present in the courtroom, under conditions of release, and was assisted by certified court interpreter. The parties agreed there were no contested facts as to the allegations made by the US Probation Officer. The Government argued that a Grade B violation is applicable in this case, highlighted defendant's reiterated violations,  and his decade-long drug addiction. Further, it argued that the appropriate sentence in this case is 12 months of imprisonment. Defense counsel argued for the application of a Grade C violation, and requested, if a finding is made as to the alleged offenses constituting a Grade B violation, that defendant be sentenced to time served followed by a term of supervised released focused on his rehabilitation. Allocution heard. The Court found that defendant violated the conditions of supervised release. Therefore, supervised release term was REVOKED. Sentence imposed- IMPR: Twelve (12) months; No supervision to follow. The Court ordered the defendant be remanded to the custody of the United States Marshal. (Court Reporter Cindy Brown.)
