Any reference to witness, co-defendant Vega having traveled with co-defendant Shepard-Fraser from Puerto Rico to New York City is a mistake. Co-defendant Vega received the defendant at the airport in NYC, and advised her to leave the luggage with a certain taxi driver called ""Manopla"". Subsequently Vega took co-defendant Shepard-Fraser to a hotel in NYC where other co- defendants couriers were lodged. Vega also subsequently paid Denisse Sheppard-Fraser $3000 for her services of transporting the luggage from Puerto Rico to New York City which was also provided on the same date and paid the same amount to other couriers of drugs. The United States produced evidence that the defendant Denisse Sheppard-Fraser returned to Puerto Rico the same date on the same Jet Blue flight as other couriers in the hotel, and defendant then went upon arrival to Puerto Rico to the house of the leader, co-defendant Manuel Santana-Cabrera, to deliver suitcases full of money product of the drugs.

04/08/2016,1057,"ORDER granting 1051 Motion Requesting Order as to Manuel Santana-Cabrera (1). Although the Court granted a nine-month sentence reduction at Docket No. 1025 , Mr. Santana-Cabrera seeks to appeal the aforementioned order. The Court's order was entered on December 14, 2015. However, Defendant was notified of the Court's ruling on December 28, 2015, by way of a letter from the Federal Public Defender's Office. This date was discerned by way of information received by the Bureau of Prisons, the Federal Public Defender's Office, and Defendant. See Docket Nos. 1047 , 1048 , 1049 , and 1051 . Although said letter contained this Court's order, it did not inform Defendant of his right to appeal or of any deadline to appeal. The notice of appeal was filed on January 12, 2016. Notwithstanding, after hearing from the Federal Public Defender's Office, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Defendant himself, the Court finds excusable neglect and/or good cause to deem the notice of appeal timely. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b) (4) and 4(c)(1). In coming to this determination, the Court relies on the four factors enunciated in Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993). Finally, pursuant to the First Circuit's instructions at Docket No. 1046 , copies of this decision shall be forwarded to the First Circuit forthwith.

05/02/2016,1061,"ORDER as to Jorge Correa-Osorio (10) regarding the First Circuit's order at Docket No. 1038 . Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1), ""a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after... the entry of... the order being appealed."" However, ""[uJpon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may--before or after the time has expired, with or without motion and notice--extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the"" aforementioned 14-day period. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4). As this is a case where the notice of appeal was filed after the required 14 days, but before the subsequent 30 days, the First Circuit has ordered that this Court determine whether it will deem the instant notice of appeal timely. Prior to ruling, the Court requested information from the Bureau of Prisons, the Federal Public Defender's Office, and Defendant himself. See Docket Nos. 1040 and 1055 . Although the Court received information from the Bureau of Prisons and the Federal Public Defender's Office, Defendant has not responded. See Docket No. 1042 . In the end, after significant scrutiny, the Court must deem the notice of appeal untimely. The Court shall explain its reasoning. On December 28, 2015, Defendant received a letter from the Federal Public Defender's Office that stated that the motion to reduce his sentence was denied in an order dated December 10, 2015. See Id. Even if the Court were to equitably take December 28, 2015, as the notification date for the order being appealed, Defendant's appeal filed on January 12, 2016, does not comply with the 14-day deadline. Moreover, Defendant has declined the Court's invitation to attempt to make any showing of ""good cause"" or ""excusable neglect"" for the delay. Notwithstanding, even an independent inspection of the record yields no reason for which to find ""good cause"" or ""excusable neglect."" Pursuant to the First Circuit's instructions, copies of this ruling shall be forwarded to the First Circuit forthwith. See Docket No. 1038 . Signed by Judge Daniel R. Dominguez on 5/2/2016.
