Present via VTC AUSA Richard Vance Eaton, and AFPD Andrew McCutcheon. USPO Carolina Aparicio also present. The defendant was under custody at MDC-Guaynabo and was assisted by certified court interpreter Sonia Crescioni. All parties connected remotely. The record should reflect the proceedings are being held by VTC, given the emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The defendant during today's hearing waived his right to be physically present for the revocation hearing and consented to proceed by VTC as filed at ECF No. 1405. The Court made a finding that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to be physically present for today's proceedings, since the defendant has consented to proceed by videoconference after consultation with his counsel of record. Certified court interpreter Sonia Crescioni was acting and assisting the defendant on a secured line at MDC-Guaynabo and the Court had a clear view of him on screen. AFPD McCutcheon proceeded to provide several mitigation factors to be considered by the Court and requested the defendant be sentenced to time served, and be allowed to travel to New York to face the charges pending against him there. The United States had no objection. The Court after hearing the parties determined not to revoke defendant Reyes-Marquez (2) but will remain under the same supervised conditions previously imposed. The Court ordered that Defendant Reyes-Marquez (2) shall be released forthwith. Upon release from MDC- Guaynabo, defendant Reyes-Marquez (2) shall report to the U.S. Probation Office. Specific instructions were given by USPO Aparicio. Then defendant will be allowed to travel to New York to face the pending charges against him. If he is convicted, he should inform the U.S. Probation Office for him to face potential revocation proceedings in this case.
