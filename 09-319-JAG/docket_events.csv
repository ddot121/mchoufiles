After hearing the testimony of the officer and holding a sidebar conference, the Court finds that there's no probable cause that a new violation to his supervised release has been commited, but taking into account that defendant is pending a final revocation hearing before Judge Garcia for another violation in which probable cause was found, the Court offered as an alternative to incarceration is to reside at a half-way house to be determined by Probation and receive mental health treatment as well as all other conditions of supervised release previously imposed. After AFPD Canino conferred with defendant, defendant accepted this proposal. USPO Reyes informed that the housing contractor will pick him up either tonight or tomorrow at MDC, and that arrangements had already been made. The Court approved this alternative and exhorted defendant to take advantage of this opportunity being afforded. MDC will release defendant to the custody of this program as soon as possible.
