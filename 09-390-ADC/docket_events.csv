The defendant waived his right to appear physically at the hearing and consented to proceed by way of VTC. Defense counsel informed that they reached an agreement with the Government for conditions of release and that, consequently, a Preliminary Revocation Hearing was not necessary. The Court granted the request for conditions of release. The defendant will be released on the following conditions: the defendant will have an EMD, submit to regular drug testing, and treatment, as deemed necessary by the USPO, plus he will comply with all other standard conditions of supervised release. Defendant shall reside in a different location than that of his partner and Defendants contact with his partner will be strictly limited to matters concerning the children. In view that Defendant is under conditions of release, he is not entitled to a preliminary revocation hearing (see F.R.Cr.P. 32.1(b)(1)(A)).
