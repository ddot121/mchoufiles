04/01/2009,370,"ORDER settling 266 Motion to Suppress as to Antonio De-Jesus-Velazquez (7) Suppression Hearing set for 4/23/2009 09:00 AM in Courtroom 11 before US Magistrate Judge Camille L. Velez-Rive.The Court has referred to this Magistrate Judge defendant Antonio De Jesus-Velazquez' motion to suppress. However, defendant De Jesus-Velzquez is apprised he should first need to establish standing as to the marihuana that was allegedly seized from a box and another individual in an open area near the motor vehicle where said defendant was located. Insofar as probable cause for the arrest, defendant De Jesus-Velazquez submits he was arrested first and then the evidence was seized, raising lack of probable cause for the arrest. Whether such action could be considered a Terry-stop or an arrest by state agents back on July 14, 2006, and how it 1s related to the federal arrest in the conspiracy charged on April 29, 2008, and/or it is but an overt act of the conspiracy, will need to be clarified at the onset of the hearing. Unless the defendant crosses this threshold, the suppression hearing will not prosper. Signed by US Magistrate Judge Camille L. Velez-Rive on 4/1/2009. (IM) (Entered: 04/01/2009) "
