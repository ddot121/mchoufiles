Present: AUSA Maria Montanez, APFD Samantha Drake and USPO Gabriel Soto. The defendant was present, under custody and assisted by a certified court interpreter. Testimonies of USPO Soto and PSO Eddie Montalvo were heard on behalf of the Government. The defense accepted the allegations of Grade C violations. However, AFPD Drake challenged the Grade B violation in the form of new criminal  conduct as alleged by the USPO at Docket No. 1614 . She argued for such conduct to be considered a Grade C violation instead. The Government argued for probable cause as to all allegations included in both motions. After having heard the parties and the testimonies of the witnesses, the Court found probable cause as to all allegations contained in Docket Nos. 1614 and 1623 . The case was referred to U.S. District Judge Carmen C. Cerezo for Final Revocation Hearing. AFPD Drake requested an order for the medical staff at MDC-Guaynabo to perform a mental health evaluation and provide medication as necessary to the defendant. The Court granted the defense's request. BOP is ordered to evaluate the defendant forthwith for the potential continuation of medication that he had been receiving for specific mental health conditions while he was previously under custody.

A preliminary revocation hearing was set for 6/4/2021 at 01:30 pm via VTC before US Magistrate Judge Marcos E. Lopez. If the government intends to call a witness that is not fluent in the English language, failure of the government to timely retain the services of an interpreter may result in the imposition of sanctions.
