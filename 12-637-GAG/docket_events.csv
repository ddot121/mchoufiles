02/12/2014,437,"ORDER denying 436 Motion to Continue as to Hiram Radriguez-Espinosa (2): Denied. The Court will not continue the sentencing hearing post November 2014 to wait and see what the Congress, President and US Sentencing Commission may ultimately do. Accordingly, the USPO Officer need not calculate an alternate and possible future- enacted guideline scenario.The court at this time does not intend to suggest what the ultimate sentence imposed will be. In the statement of facts (docket # 379) defendant admits that he is responsible for 3.5-5 kilos of cocaine. However, this is not all. He was also a supplier who possessed firearms to protect the drug point operations. Here, thus, we are not talking about an unarmed defendant who merely participated in a low level capacity in the drug venture. While the court 1s mindful that as part of the plea agreement the 18 USC sec 924(c) count will be dismissed for sentencing purposes, such admitted conduct does not vanish into thin air accordingly. Such overall conduct as part of a plea agreement will be considered by the court at sentencing now, and even had the mandatory minimums been lowered.Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 2/12/14.
