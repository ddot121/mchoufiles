07/27/2020,723,"ORDER denying without prejudice Defendant (9) Luis Marrero-Marrero's 708 and 722 Motions. Defendant has failed to establish that compassionate release 1s warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Defendant has failed to establish: (1) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; and (2) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. While Defendant is being treated for high cholesterol, there is no indication that his condition (determined to be in Care Level 1, healthy or simple chronic care) would increase for Defendant the risks posed by COVID- 19 infection beyond the risks posed to the general population. See United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 poses in the federal prison system... But the mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus's spread.""); United States v.

07/27/2020,724,"ORDER denying without prejudice Defendant (7) Wilfredo Mendozas 709 Motion.  Defendant has failed to establish that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies; (2) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (3) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (4) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Even assuming, without deciding, that the Court may excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Defendant's motion lacks evidence supporting the allegations of preexisting health conditions that would increase for Defendant the risks posed by COVID-19 infection beyond the risks posed to the general population. See United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 poses in the federal prison system...

Finally, Defendant has failed to show this Court has jurisdiction over his request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmate's place of incarceration.
