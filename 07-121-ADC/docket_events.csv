02/20/2018,2769,"Minute Entry for proceedings held before Chief Judge Aida M. Delgado-Colon:Case called for Hearing on Revocation of Supervised Release as to Hector Garcia-Cartagena (24) held on February 20, 2018. Present were AUSA Kelly Zenon-Matos, and AFPD Edwin A. Mora-Rolland. The defendant was present in court, under the custody of the U.S. Marshals, and was assisted by certified interpreter. The defendant waived the hearing, and accepted the allegations as stated at the motions filed by the U.S. Probation Office. Counsel for the defendant proceeded to provide relevant mitigating circumstances to be considered by the Court. The defense presented legal arguments concerning the grade of violations, and Articles 401, and 406 of the Local Law, and requested a finding of a Grade B violation be determined and be sentenced to a term of 18 to 24 months of imprisonment to be served concurrently to the terms imposed at local level. Defendant's allocution heard. The United States stated that the guidelines to be applied in this case should be a Type B violation, and requested that the defendant be sentenced to 3 years to be served consecutively with the terms imposed at local level. The Court after having heard the arguments presented by the defense related to the United States' burden to present for today's hearing translations of the charging document, and the judgment issued at local level, continued the proceedings. The Court instructed Norman J. Rosario, U.S. Probation Officer to get translations of the documents in controversy from the local court within 30 days. Once translations are  filed, the defense shall place its position for the record, and then, the United States shall reply.
