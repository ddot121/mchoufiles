Present were AUSA Enrique Silva, AFPD Samantha Drake, USPO Angelica Rodriguez. Defendant was OB and assisted by a certified court interpreter. Defendant was present via telephone. All other parties were present via VTC. Counsel for the defendant attested that the defendant was the person appearing by telephone. The defendant waived his right to appear physically at the hearing and consented to proceed via telephone conference. Government argued in favor of the USPO's request for conditions to be modified to include electronic monitoring for a period of three months. Defendant requested for the Court to consider other alternatives, such as a curfew and daily check- ins with USPO. Having heard the parties, the Court recommends that the USPO's request, as joined by the Government, be granted by the presiding district judge. The Court finds that there appears to be no general dispute that the defendant committed the acts as alleged in the motion, that 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(4) provides the Court with the authority to impose home detention with electronic monitoring and that this changed condition is reasonably relevant to the alleged violation of his conditions of release, as well as necessary for the USPO to continue supervising the defendant.
