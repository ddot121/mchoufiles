Defendant has failed to establish that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies; (2) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (3) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (4) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Even assuming, without deciding, that the Court may excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Defendant's motion lacks specific information or evidence supporting the allegations of preexisting health conditions that would increase for Defendant the risks posed by COVID-19 infection beyond the risks posed to the general population. See United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 poses in the federal prison system... But the mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the virus's spread.""); United States v. Eberhart, 2020 WL 1450745, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2020) (""[A] reduction of sentence due solely to concerns about the spread of COVID-19 is not consistent with the applicable policy statement of the Sentencing Commission as required by § 3582(c) (1)(A).""). Defendant may refile the present motion provided he submits evidence to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Finally, Defendant has failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction over his request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmate's place of incarceration.

02/16/2021,1357,"ORDER denying without prejudice 1336 Motion for Compassionate Release - 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) as to Raymond E. Hiraldo-Figueroa (4); noted 1343 Motion in Compliance as to Raymond E. Hiraldo-Figueroa (4). Defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing that compassionate release is warranted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies; (2) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (3) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (4) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Even if the Court were to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, Defendant's motion lacks specific information and evidence supporting the allegations of preexisting health conditions that would increase for Defendant the risks posed by COVID-19 infection beyond the risks posed to the general population. See United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 poses in the federal prison system... But the mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the  virus's spread.""). While Defendant claims to suffer from hyperlipidemia, this condition is not included in the CDC's list of underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Defendant has similarly failed to show that he does not pose a danger to the community, considering the crimes of conviction, his leadership role in the offense, and his disciplinary infractions while imprisoned (including assault without serious injury, possession of a dangerous weapon, and fighting with another inmate); or that a sentence reduction would be consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements. For these reasons, Defendant's Motion is hereby DENIED without prejudice. Defendant may refile the present motion provided he submits evidence to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). Finally, Defendant has failed to show that this Court has jurisdiction over any request for home confinement, considering that the BOP is solely responsible for determining an inmates place of incarceration.

02/16/2021,1358,"ORDER as to Miguel A. Canales-Villalongo (1) denying with prejudice 1335 Motion for Reconsideration. This is Defendant's fourth motion requesting a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582, yet it still suffers from the same deficiencies previously identified by the Court. See Docket Nos. 1300; 1302; 1327. Specifically, Defendant has failed to establish: (1) exhaustion of administrative remedies; (2) extraordinary and compelling reasons justifying a reduction in sentence; (3) that he does not pose a danger to the community; and (4) that a sentence reduction is consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Even though Defendant is overweight and suffers from asthma, FCI Allenwood Low seems to be taking adequate steps to prevent outbreaks considering that it has maintained low numbers of active cases and, currently, only has 1 inmate with COVID-19. Thus, Defendant has not shown extraordinary and compelling circumstances. Moreover, Defendant has not shown that he does not pose a danger to others, considering his drug and firearm convictions, leadership role in the crimes charged, and prior conviction for aggravated battery. Considering that Defendant has had 4 opportunities to request relief under § 3582 to no avail, the request is hereby DENIED WITH PREJUDICE. Defendant may not refile this petition.
