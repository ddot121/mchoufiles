AUSA Dina Avila and AUSA Jeannette Mercado and defense counsel Rafael Castro-Lang, Jose Aguayo and Juan R. Acevedo were present. The Court noted that no motion to withdraw from counsel Luis R. Rivera-Rodriguez has been filed and notice that counsel Castro-Lang has been retained. Defendant Delgado-Rodriguez expressed that his attorney is Rafael Castro-Lang and no longer Atty. Luis R. Rivera-Rodriguez. Attorney Aguayo also represents a co-defendant in the case and the Government believes that there may be a potential conflict of interest. The Court will set a Foster Hearing for 2/19/08. Testimony of Task Force S/A Victor Lopez was heard on behalf of the Government. Defense counsel Aguayo was heard by proffer. After viewing the evidence and hearing the testimony, the Court finds defendant not to be a flight risk. The Court is inclined to home detention and the wearing of an electronic monitoring device for defendant Arroyo-Arroyo. Information received from Probation Office, Pretrial Division, indicating that defendants with pacemakers are not eligible for the wearing or use of an electronic monitoring device. Therefore, defendant Arroyo-Arroyo is ordered detained without bail pending trial. A separate order will be issued. As to defendant Delgado-Rodriguez, Atty. Castro-Lang requested a continuance of the hearing for Monday. The Court granted the request. A Further Bail Hearing is set for 2/11/08 at 3:30 p.m. Govn't Exhs Adm.: 1 thru 5.

Defense counsel Hector Deliz informs the Court that a motion for reconsideration was filed on 2/25/08 (docket #584) and is heard. The Court, after hearing all counsel on their oral motions for reconsideration, vacates the order imposing sanctions as to all the attorneys that were sanctioned. Counsel are admonished to look carefully at notices, particularly in multi- defendant cases. The absence of attorneys in multi-defendant cases sometimes requires the Court to reschedule multiple hearings, thus unnecessarily protracting the proceedings. In its decision to vacate the sanctions imposed, the Court is taking into account that some attorneys have acknowledged candidly that they did receive notice, but that they might have overlooked the same, and that others have mentioned that due to the fact that this case has been managed in groups some inadvertent confusion may have arisen. Nevertheless, counsel are hereby put on notice that future absences of this nature may result in imposition of sanctions. (Court Reporter FTR.) (mn) (Entered: 03/04/2008) "
