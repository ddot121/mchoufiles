04/19/2021,1275,"Minute Entry for proceedings held before US Magistrate Judge Marcos E. Lopez: Preliminary Revocation Hearing as to Christian Nieves-Amill (9) held on 4/19/2021 via VTC. Present were AUSA Juan Reyes, AFPD John Connors and USPO Gabriel Arrillaga. The defendant was present under custody and assisted by a certified court interpreter. The defendant waived his right to appear physically at the hearing and consented to proceed via telephone as he currently is under quarantine, all other participants were present via video. Defense counsel informed to the Court that his client is not entitled to a preliminary revocation hearing due to the fact that an Indictment has been filed against him. The Government informed that they're only moving for revocation as to the allegations that are related to the charges contained in the Indictment filed against the defendant. After hearing the parties, the Court made a finding of probable cause based only on the Indictment filed in Criminal Case 21-123, as the allegations that the Government is seeking revocation for are encompassed in both the motion filed by the USPO at D.E. 1267 and the Indictment. Case is referred to Judge Francisco A. Besosa for setting of a final revocation hearing. The defendant will remain detained pending further revocation proceedings.
