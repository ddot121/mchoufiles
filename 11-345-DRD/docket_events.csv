Santiago-Velez's (""Defendant"" or ""Petitioner"") Emergency Motion for Compassionate Release Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582 (c)(1)(A) (""Motion for Compassionate Release""). See Docket No. 2004 . In essence, Defendant requests the Court to reduce his sentence to time served, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3582 (c)(1)(A)Q), in attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, Petitioner contends that: (1) he has medical conditions - high blood pressure and type-2 diabetes- which place him at risk in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) he already contracted COVID-19 on December 2020 and continues to experience lingering effects; (3) he has trouble speaking to the medical staff at his facility, since they do not speak Spanish; and (4) he has a valid release plan and does not present a danger to the general population. In opposition, the Government contests that: (1) Petitioner failed to provide evidence to support his allegation related to the exhausted administrative remedies; (2) Defendant failed to provide any evidence as to his medical conditions nor evidence to support the fact that he is not receiving regular medical care; and (3) Defendant does present a risk to the general population. See Docket No. 2007 . After reviewing the Parties' arguments, the Court agrees with the  Government. First, although the Court acknowledges the dangers and challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon the Bureau of Prisons (""BOP"") and the inmate population, the pandemic -by itself- is not an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason to award compassionate release under 18 U.S.C.  3582. See United States v. Raia, 954 F. 3d 594, 597 (3rd Cir. 2020) (""We do not mean to minimize the risks that COVID-19 pose in the federal prison system [...] But the mere existence of COVID-19 in society and the possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot independently justify compassionate release, especially considering BOP's statutory role, and its extensive and professional efforts to curtail the viruss spread.""). On the other hand, the record reveals that Petitioner did not provide any documentation to support his allegations of exhaustion of administrative remedies and underlying health conditions. Finally, the Court highlights that Petitioner plead guilty to charges that identified him as a leader or organizer of a drug point involved with the possession of firearms and possession and distribution of narcotics. Due to the severity of the charges, Petitioner's arguments do not convince the Court that he will not a be a danger to the general population. Considering all of the above, the Court finds that Defendant has failed to meet his burden under 18 U.S.C.  3582 (c)(1)(A)(i). Consequently, his Motion for Compassionate Release is hereby DENIED.

04/28/2021,2021,"ORDER denying 2020 Motion for Reconsideration as to Juan C. Santiago- Velez (2). Previously, the Court denied Juan C. Santiago-Velez's (""Defendant"") Motion for Compassionate Release. See Docket No. 2012 . Unsatisfied, Defendant filed a Motion for Reconsideration where he alleged that he was providing the Court with a copy of his medical records and the receipt of the denial of his request for compassionate release presented before the Warden; however, Defendant's motion did not include said documents. Nonetheless, the Court notes that unlike the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not provide for motions for  reconsideration. In fact, the First Circuit has consistently held that motions for reconsideration in criminal cases are not specifically authorized either by statute or by rule. United States v. Ortiz, 741 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 2014). If a District Court where to entertain a motion for reconsideration in a criminal procedure, it must apply the standards set for motions for reconsideration under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See, e.g., United States v. Allen, 573 F.3d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 2009). In said context, [t]he granting of a motion for reconsideration is 'an extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly."" Palmer v. Champion Mortg., 465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2006). ""The district court has rather broad authority to grant or to deny such a motion"". See United States v. Parcel of Land & Residence Located thereon at 5 Bell Rock Rd., Freetown, Mass., 896 F.2d 605, 611 (1st Cir. 1990); Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1987). Furthermore, as to the standard applicable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, motions for reconsideration are to be entertained by courts if they seek to correct manifest errors of law, present newly discovered evidence, or when there is an intervening change in law. See, e.g., Prescott v. Higgins, 538 F.3d 32, 45 (1st Cir. 2008); Rivera Surillo & Co. v. Falconer Glass Indus., Inc., 37 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1994).
