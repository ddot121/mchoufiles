Nieves-Rivera re: 984 Notice of Appeal - Final Judgment; We note that, in the plea agreement, the defendant and the government agreed to recommend to the sentencing judge that the federal sentence run concurrently with specified sentences imposed by a Commonwealth court. At the very brief sentencing hearing, however, neither party expressly called this provision to the sentencing court's attention, and sentence was imposed without the sentencing judge addressing concurrency. Since the default rule is that ""[mJultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently, 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a), the effect of silence is that the federal sentence runs consecutively to the Commonwealth sentences. We ask the sentencing judge to clarify whether consecutive sentences was the judge's intention and to transmit his answer in writing to this court. (xi) (Entered: 01/23/2013) "

09/18/2017,1769,"REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION as to Joel Marrero-Marrero (36). During the preliminary revocation hearing for violations of supervised release, the Defendant accepted the allegations contained in the motion by USPO at Docket. No. 1722 , except the one pertaining to new criminal conduct. The Defendant argued that the domestic violence charges were dismissed, therefore, no violation to Statutory Condition No.1 was committed. The Court needed to determine if the underlying conduct that gave rise to the dismissed charges could violate Standard Condition No.1. The parties proffered to the Court the recordings of conversations between the defendant and his partner, as well as copies of the text messages between them. After reviewing the text messages and listening to the recordings the court finds that there was no threat amounting to what can be construed as domestic violence. The defendant and his partner offended one another, were disrespectful towards one another and used foul language on both sides. I do not find probable cause to violate the defendant on the violation of Standard Condition No. 1.

06/17/2019,1903,"ORDER as to Pablo J. Figueroa-Vazquez (27). A preliminary revocation hearing was held today in relation to Docket Nos. 1890 and 1901 in which USPO Norman Rosario testified. Minutes will follow. Just before starting the cross-examination, defense counsel requested the chronological notes under Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2. A review of the docket shows that the request was not done prior to the hearing. The request was orally denied without prejudice and the undersigned herein amplifies the reasons for the denial. Rule 26.2 only applies to statements in the government's possession, and the government does not have the probation officer's chronological notes as they are confidential records which were prepared by the probation officer for use in carrying out her duties as a member of the judiciary, not as an arm of the government or part of the prosecution. See United States v. Rivera-Rodrguez, 321 F.Supp. 3d 278 (D.P.R. 2018) ("" [t]he probation officer's chronological notes undisputedly constitute confidential records which [are] prepared by the probation officer for the use in carrying out [his or] her duties as a member of the judiciary, not as an arm of the prosecution.""); United States v. Rockot, 2013 WL 5536224 (W.D. Pa. 2013) (unpublished, same); United States v. Houston, 2009 WL 2488176 at *53 (E.D.Cal., 2009) (unpublished, the chrono notes [of a probation officer] are not in the government's constructive possession and so are not subject to production under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2""); United States v. Washington, 146 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir. 1998) (""[A] probation officer... [is a] neutral, information-gathering agent of the court, not an agent of the prosecution.""); United States v. Ritter, 45 Fed.Appx, 609 (unpublished) (Due process did not require the government to produce the probation officer's notes because the notes were not used as evidence against Ritter. See United States v. Donaghe, 924 F.2d 940, 944 (9th Cir. 1991). Further, lack of access to the notes did not compromise Ritter's rights under the confrontation clause to a fair and meaningful opportunity to refute or impeach the evidence against him. See United States v. Martin, 984 F.2d 308, 310 (9th Cir. 1993).'""). The undersigned sees no reason to deviate from the above under the circumstances of this case at this stage. Defendant was advised that he may file a motion requesting the chronological notes to the presiding District Judge for her to consider the request prior to the final revocation hearing.
