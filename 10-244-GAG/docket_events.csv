Today, the parties filed a joint motion requesting that the hearing be vacated on the same grounds. Therefore, the Court hereby GRANTS the parties' request to vacate the preliminary hearing and refers the matter to U.S. District Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi for final revocation hearing. The defendant shall remain under the same conditions of release pending further proceedings. As to the defense's motion for disclosure, the Court GRANTS the request and orders the USPO to produce all evidence directly related to the alleged SRT violations as well as any evidence that will be used by the Government at the final hearing. Should that evidence include any chronos, the USPO is ordered to produce only those chronos related to the alleged violations, including notes that may exculpate the defendant's conduct, after the same have been redacted to protect or conceal information regarding third parties, or any information that may compromise the personal safety of any individual. Preliminary Revocation Hearing set for 12/14/2020 is VACATED. Final Hearing re Revocation of Supervised Release set for 3/11/2021 09:00 AM in Old San Juan Courtroom before Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi.
