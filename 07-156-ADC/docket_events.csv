On October 9, 2007, this court ordered, at the joint request of the parties, that defendant be transferred to the Bureau of Prisons (""BOP"") facility in Butner, North Carolina, or some other appropriate facility to be designated by the BOP, to receive a mental competency evaluation and treatment. (Docket No. 230). The Clerk notified the BOP and the USMS of this order the following day. The court has been informed that as of today - more than three months after the order was notified - the BOP still has not designated the defendant to an appropriate facility. Given the BOP's failure to cooperate and to comply with the court's order, I see no alternative but to keep the defendant at MDC Guaynabo and to appoint a mental health professional to perform the evaluation. Accordingly, the order to transfer the defendant entered at Docket No. 230 is hereby VACATED, and the USMS and BOP are hereby ORDERED to keep the defendant at MDC Guaynabo pending any further order of the court. The Clerk shall notify the USMS and MDC Guaynabo of this order by telephone and fax. Signed by US Magistrate Judge Bruce J. McGiverin on January 25, 2008.(McGiverin, Bruce) (Entered: 01/25/2008) "
