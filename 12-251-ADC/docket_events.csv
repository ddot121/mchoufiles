Defendant assisted by Court Interpreter. Previous CJA counsel Ruben Cerezo also present. Upon inquiry of the Court, attorney Cerezo explained how Attorney Espada became counsel of his former  client. The defendant, being assisted by attorney Espada, was also inquired on the matter and defendant's sister Ms. Maria Lopez who was in court was inquired as well. Attorney Espada informed she had been retained by defendant's sister to represent him in this case and in CR 10-0251-15 (JAF) for post conviction remedies. Court notes that there was no indication on the record that defendant was not satisfied with his previous CJA counsel and that the CJA-23 Financial Affidavit completed by defendant showed he had no resources to retain counsel and that as informed by counsel, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the same plea offer already negotiated by attorney Cerezo. Court will look further into the matter due to its legal source of concern pursuant to Section 230.40. Court will encourage other judicial officers to do so as well and consider if when such a situation as this arises that defendant might be ordered to reimburse monies spent under CJA funds when relatives retain counsel on defendant's behalf. Attorney Cerezo's motion to file CJA Voucher is Granted. (Court Reporter Diane Breaz.) Hearing set for 3:00 p.m. Hearing held at 3:20 p.m. Hearing ended at 4:00 p.m. Interpreter Felix Toledo.
