SAUSA Kelly Zenon and defense counsel Juan Alvarez were present. As to Arraignment, the Court finds defendant competent at this time. Defendant waived the reading of the Indictment. Plea of Not Guilty is entered. Defense is granted seven (7)  days to obtain discovery and fourteen (14) days thereafter to file all motions. The case is referred to the Judge for trial setting thereafter. As to Bail, defense counsel disagreed with the recommendation in the pretrial report. Counsel proffered that relatives were present in court, defendant's mother is willing to serve as third party custodian and post her only property as collateral for bail. Counsel moved for bail to be set and that release conditions be imposed. The Government proffered defendant's role and/or participation in the case, that defendant was a fugitive since he was indicted in September and requested detention due to danger to the community and risk of flight. After listening to the parties, the Court finds that the weight of the evidence is strong and ordered defendant detained without bail pending trial. (Court Reporter FTR/bg.) Hearing set for 09:15.
