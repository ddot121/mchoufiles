03/25/2009,2348,"Minute Entry for proceedings held before US Magistrate Judge Camille L. Velez-Rive: Present were AUSA Jose Capo, Mr. Ramon Gonzalez-Santiago, PTO Nancy Mendez. Bail Hearing as to Jorge Fournier-Olavarria held on 3/25/2009. The Court ordered the attorneys for the parties to meet in one of the jury rooms and review the defendant's medical records at MDC, provided by Dr. Ada Rivera, MDC's medical director, who was present in Court. After reviewing the record, speaking with the defendant, and sidebar meeting with the Court, the Court ruled that its only concern at this point was defendant's health, but that the issue of his health is not enough grounds to grant bail. The Court also stated that it would issue an order to MDC to evaluate defendant and provide treatment, including referral to a specialist if so needed, within the next ten days. Bail is denied, and docket entries number 2175 and 2335 are also denied. Order to issue.

Counsel for defendant informed that they are waiving the hearing. Waiver of Preliminary Hearing was filed. The Court approved the same and made a finding of probable cause. Case is referred to Judge Juan M. Perez-Gimenez for setting of Final Revocation Hearing. Defense counsel requested that the defendant be placed in an inpatient drug treatment program. Neither the government nor the probation office had any objection. Therefore, the parties are all in agreement that the defendant should be released to an inpatient drug treatment program pending the final revocation hearing, one of the reasons being the defendant's health issues. The Court is inclined to follow the recommendation and issue an order for her release as he is authorized to do by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(a)(6). However, there is an order from the presiding district judge entered at docket 4865 which orders the defendant to remain detained. The Court is, therefore, bound by that order.
